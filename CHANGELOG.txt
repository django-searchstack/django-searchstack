=== 1.0.0pre1 (Unreleased) ===

- Fix DecimalField to convert search results to actual Decimal instance (not string as it used to)
- Split CharField into CharField (non-analyzed string; becomes functionally equivalent to FacetCharField in old impl) and
  TextField (analyzed string; equivalend to CharField in old impl). This is a breaking change but necessary since 
  all FacetField* classes will be removed eventually.
- Replace default value for field default to None since field value becomes None if default is not provided
- Remove simple_backend (which was useless) and whoosh_backend (which could be reborn as a third party project)
- Rename top level module and other 'haystack*' names to 'searchstack'
- Add Django 1.9 support
- Change configuration setting namespace to SEARCHSTACK_
- Remove long time ago deprecated API code
- Remove python<2.7 and Django<1.7 compatibility code
- Load routers lazily (fixes Haystack#1034)
- Changed all internal imports from absolute to relative


Forked from django-haystack (last commit 2016-01-18)
